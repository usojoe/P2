# P1 Project

This is the readme file for Project One, located at p1.josephandrewlee.com

This project is designed to teach the GitHub and Digital Ocean workflow and refesh students' html and css skills. My project includes a bit of extra flare in that I added a bootstrap responsive framework and linked the project repositories.

Here is a link to the screencast demo of my project: https://youtu.be/AslaoAoKkBQ

Besides Bootstrap there is no outside code used.

Enjoy!!
