# P2 Project

This is the readme file for Project Two, located at p2.josephandrewlee.com

This project is designed to teach basic PHP coding skills. For me, this was a excercise for my patience, as it took me days to figure out how to code this thing in a way that works. I'm so proud that I got it to work, and that didn't happen until the final day it was due so I didn't have that much time to make it pretty.

Here is a link to the screencast demo of my project:  https://youtu.be/oZ7MytqPTFo

Besides Bootstrap there are no outside code snippets used.

Enjoy!
